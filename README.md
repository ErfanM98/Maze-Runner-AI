# Maze-Runner-AI
Reinforcement Learning and Q-Learning in Maze Runner Game


This project will implement the policy iteration and value iterations algorithms in the Maze Runner game.

**Initiating the program**

The input of the program is a text file as represented below:
The text file's first line indicates the number of rows and columns, respectively.
Then there are rows*coloumns lines representing each cell of the game; every line consists of 4 numbers showing which sides of the cell are accessible or blocked in this pattern: North East South West.
For example, 1 0 1 0 means we can only access the north and south sides.
Then at the last line of the file, two numbers represent the agent's position.
